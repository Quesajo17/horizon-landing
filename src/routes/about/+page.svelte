    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="content">
<p>Nearly a decade ago, my husband, Charlie and I set
 out on months of travel around the world. After saving for years, 
 selling much of our belongings and leaving our jobs we boarded our 
 one way ticket to Europe. </p>
 <p>Through the highs of living with locals, visiting places we only , 
    indulging in new cuisine, history and sights and the challenges of
     health scares, disagreements, language barriers and navigating 
     foreign cities we grew a new understanding about ourselves, our 
     values and the world around us.</p>
 <p>When we returned home, we were inspired and motivated to change a few 
    things in our daily life because of our trip. We moved, we chose to own 
    less and felt committed to keeping the open mind and sense of adventure 
    we had while traveling. At home, if felt like our travels came alive 
    again in new and unexpected ways. </p>
 <p>What we learned from our own experience and from talking to, and reading 
    about, dozens of other travelers… traveling often unlocks something, 
    brings a new appreciation, reminds us of what we forgot or clarifies 
    something cloudy. What better place than home to turn those insights 
    into reality? However “small” or “big” they may seem.</p>
 <p>We wanted to create a journal that supported this experience of travel: 
    one full of anticipation and excitement, unexpected highs and challenges 
    and meaningful changes, appreciation and insights upon one’s return home. </p>
 <p>Hence, Horizon Travel Journal came to be. </p>
