    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="content">
<p>Nearly a decade ago, my husband Charlie and I set off on an extended 
    journey around the world. After years of saving, selling much of 
    what we owned, and leaving our jobs behind, we boarded a one-way flight 
    to Europe—equal parts nervous and excited.</p>
 <p>We experienced the highs of living with locals, indulging in new cuisine, 
    soaking in gorgeous landscapes, learning unfamiliar history and embracing 
    the freedom of unstructured time. We also faced the challenges of health 
    scares, a tight budget, language barriers, disagreements and constantly 
    navigating the unknown. Through it all, we discovered more about 
    ourselves, our values, and the world around us.</p>
 <p>When we returned home, we were inspired and motivated to change a few 
    things in our daily life. We moved. We chose to own less. We were 
    committed to keeping the open mind and sense of adventure we had while 
    traveling. In unexpected ways, our journey began to shape our everyday 
    lives.</p>
 <p>What we learned from our own experience and from talking to, and reading
     about, dozens of other travelers… traveling often unlocks something, 
     brings a new appreciation, reminds us of what we forgot or gives us 
     clarity. What better place than home to turn those insights into reality? </p>
 <p>We created <b>Horizon Travel Journal</b> to honor this journey. It's 
    designed to capture the full arc of travel—its anticipation and 
    excitement, its surprises and challenges, and the meaningful shifts 
    that can emerge when we return home. 
    Whether your travels are across the globe or close to home, we hope 
    this journal helps you plan, reflect, appreciate, and bring the spirit 
    of travel into everyday life.</p>
